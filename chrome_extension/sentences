i love the smell of napalm in the morning
live long and prosper 
the First rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club
they may take our lives but they'll never take our freedom
nobody puts baby in a corner
say hello to my little friend
dude where's my car
honey i shrunk the kids
to infinity and beyond
tonight we dine in hell
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good
the lannisters send their regards
a lannister always pays his debts
what do we say to the god of death
what is dead may never die
by order of the peaky blinders
a girl has no name
this aggression will not stand man
you don't mess with the zohan
you're a wizard harry
you had my curiosity now you have my attention
